**Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration** 
         The aim of this project is to develop a solution  to users with the ability to access and analyse data that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
         
**TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED :** The process involves:

**Data Extraction:** Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.(**Github Cloning**)

**Data Transformation:** Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

**Database Insertion:** Storing transformed data in a SQLite3 database.

**Dashboard Creation:** Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard, In an advance way to get animation effects

**Data Retrieval:** Fetching data directly from the database of SQLITE to dynamically update the dashboard.

**REQUIRED LIBRARIES:**


1. plotly.express

2.streamlit

3.sqlalchemy

4.sqlite3

5.pandas

6.PIL

7.matplotlib.pyplot

**FEATURES of my App:** The following functions are available in my Pluse Project. Retrieval of data Year wise,Quarter wise,State and District wise.Even more pincode wise
Registered users details with on which brand of Mobile Transaction is been done.

Collecting of data and store temporary in pandas dataframe.

Migration of data from the dataframe to a SQLITE database directly for efficient querying and analysis.

Search and retrieval of data from the SQLITE database using different search options
